This program makes use of a program called crontab.
Install crontab then call crontab -e.
If you would like to use a different editor than the default then type in export VISUAL=program_name_here before typing in the last line
Then place the line below into the file:
0 * * * * path_to/get_ping.sh
Then run sudo crond.

This will ping every hour and add the data to networklog.txt
